Description
===========
This repository contains electronic supporting information for the paper
**Genesis of the chirality of polythiophene aggregates from classical
molecular dynamics** submitted by N. Romagnoli and D. Padula.

This repository contains quantum-mechanically derived Force Fields (QMD-FFs)
fitted with the Joyce program, used to describe polymers studied in the paper.
In particular, we provide the QMD-FFs for the target molecule and for the
largest oligomer, as well as geometries used for Hamiltonian Replica Exchange
simulations.

For further clarifications, please contact us at the email address reported in
the paper.
